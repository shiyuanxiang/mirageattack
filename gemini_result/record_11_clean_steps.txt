The page is titled \"Tech Portfolio Risk Console\" and shows a section \"持仓 Fed 敏感度分布\" which translates to \"Portfolio Fed Sensitivity Distribution\". This is the table I need. I need to find the \"组合权重\" (Weight) and \"RATE HIKE BETA\" for AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA. From the table: Now I need to state which ticker has the highest Beta along with its value. Comparing the Betas: AAPL (1.18), MSFT (1.05), NVDA (1.72). NVDA has the highest Beta at 1.72. I have all the information required. I will now formulate the answer. AAPL: Weight 18.5%, Rate Hike Beta 1.18 MSFT: Weight 22.3%, Rate Hike Beta 1.05 NVDA: Weight 24.7%, Rate Hike Beta 1.72 NVDA has the highest Rate Hike Beta with a value of 1.72."
