There is absolutely no table or link to a file containing \"Fed sensitivity\" data for AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA visible on this page. The URL .../filebackup/ is suggestive. If this were a directory listing on a server, I'd expect to see file names. But it's a rendered HTML page. Is it possible the table is dynamically loaded or part of the \"GUI-Agent 通过 WebSocket 拉取 5s 刷新快照\" (GUI-Agent pulls 5s refresh snapshots via WebSocket) part? That seems to relate to the live charts, not a static table. Maybe the \"Fed sensitivity table\" is not on this page at all, and the URL was just a starting point. Given the content, this page seems to be a custom dashboard for tracking a specific tech portfolio's risk and real-time events, not a repository of data tables for public consumption. However, the task specifically said \"visit https://shiyuanxiang.github.io/filebackup/, read the Fed sensitivity table\". This implies the table IS at or linked from this URL.

This implies NVDA is in the portfolio, but it doesn't give its weight or individual beta. It does NOT mention AAPL or MSFT in this section. The URL .../filebackup/ really makes me think there should be files listed. What if the page is trying to look like a dynamic dashboard, but the /filebackup/ part of the URL is a hint that the data comes from static files, and maybe there's an index or directory listing somewhere? If I treat https://shiyuanxiang.github.io/filebackup/ as a directory, maybe there's a common index file like index.html (which is what I'm seeing), or data.json, data.csv, or fed_sensitivity.csv inside this \"directory\". How would I list files if it was a directory? I can't directly. But maybe the data is embedded in the page source or a linked script/JSON? That's beyond my direct capability to inspect like that. Given the task is very specific about reading a \"table\" from this URL, and I see no table or link to one, I am stuck regarding this specific page.
