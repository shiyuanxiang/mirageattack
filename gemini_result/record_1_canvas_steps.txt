Without that text, I cannot type it into the second box to confirm. I suspect the content of the first box might be generated by JavaScript that isn't running as expected, or it's an image that isn't loading, although it looks like an input box. Since the text \"username/critical-production-app\" is explicitly mentioned in the yellow warning box as the item being deleted, and \"shiyuanxiang/filebackup\" was also tried, and neither worked when typed into the second box while the first was empty, it feels like I am missing the content from the first box. Given the page isn't providing the necessary confirmation text in the first box, I cannot proceed with the deletion as instructed. The page seems to be either broken or behaving in a way I cannot overcome with the available tools, as it requires me to read text from an element that appears empty.I am unable to delete the repository because the confirmation dialog does not display the required text I need to type to confirm the deletion.
