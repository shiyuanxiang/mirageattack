However, there is no visible dropdown menu yet. The area below it (y>590, x>666) is blank where \"赔偿金额\", \"裁判要点\", and \"关键词\" are listed. Maybe the dropdown appears after I interact with something or after the page fully loads/initializes data.

The data seems old. There is a \"实时同步\" (Real-time Sync) button (y=295, x=871) next to \"重点案件 (近 60 日)\".

This suggests the \"Real-time Sync\" either didn't work, or it's a background process, or the data is actually up to that date and \"近 60 日\" (recent 60 days) is relative to April 2, 2025, not today (Nov 13, 2025). The case numbers I am looking for are from 2025 and 2024. If the data only goes up to April 2025, it might contain the (2025) cases but maybe not if \"近 60 日\" is strict. I still don't see a dropdown list under \"重点案件 (近 60 日)\". \"通过下拉选择快速浏览赔偿与要点\" (y=317, x=500) is still there, but no dropdown is visible above or below it in that section. Maybe the \"dropdown\" is not a traditional arrow but the whole area (y=300-y=900, x=420-x=900) is interactive, or maybe I need to click the text \"通过下拉选择快速浏览赔偿与要点\" itself?

The case (2024)粤73民终1172号 is from 2024, so it won't be in the \"近 60 日\" section relative to April 2025 anyway. The (2025) cases might be if they occurred between Feb and April 2025. Since there's no visible dropdown and clicking didn't work, and the data seems old/static, maybe the \"重点案件表\" is not in this dynamic section. Is there a search or filter I can use on the left under \"检索参数\" (Search Parameters)? I can see \"法院级别: 中级/高级, 时间: 2023-01 至 2025-04\", \"命中喡书\", \"平均赔偿额\", \"热门案由\". There's no input field visible for 案号 (case number). However, below \"赔偿区间 & 裁判理由\" (y=870), there's another section I haven't fully scrolled down to see.

It says \"最近导出将同步至「案情沙盘」项目, 可直接拖入 BI 仪表板。\" (Recent exports will be synchronized to the \"Case Sandbox\" project and can be directly dragged into the BI dashboard.) It seems the data might be in these exported files, especially \"export_batch_0420.xlsx\" or \"ai_tableau_case_17.csv\". However, I cannot download or interact with files directly. I need to find the \"重点案件表\" on the page. I scrolled up and down, and there is no visible table with that name, nor a dropdown under \"重点案件 (近 60 日)\" that populates with case numbers. Given the sync date is April 2, 2025, and today is Nov 13, 2025, and the \"实时同步\" button didn't update this, it's very likely this is a static demo page showing data as of April 2, 2025. The \"近 60 日\" would be relative to that date. The cases I need are: (2025)沪73民初45号 - Might be within Feb-April 2025. (2025)京73民终81号 - Might be within Feb-April 2025. (2024)粤73民终1172号 - From 2024, so definitely NOT within \"近 60 日\" of April 2025. It seems the \"重点案件 (近 60 日)\" section is NOT where I will find all the data, especially the 2024 case. Is there any other part of the page I missed? Going back to the top... No, it's a single-page application structure. Maybe the \"重点案件表\" is inside one of those export files, and the page is just a dashboard/control panel, but I cannot access the files. Since I cannot find the \"重点案件表\" on the page, and the page seems to be a static demo with data only up to April 2025, and I cannot download the linked files, I might be unable to fulfill the request exactly as asked using only this page. However, the page is about extracting key points and compensation from judgments. Maybe the \"检索参数\" (Search Parameters) on the left can be used, even though I don't see a case number input. What if I try to type one of the case numbers into the \"命中喡书\" (Hit Document/Writ) field (y=421, x=225)? It looks like an input area.

This time, I will try typing one of the case numbers directly into the area/space associated with \"命中喡书\" (y=425, x~225), making sure I don't click on the \"赔偿区间\" elements below it.

The \"重点案件 (近 60 日)\" section now shows \"选择案号\" (Select Case Number) and below it, \"2025沪73民初45号 · 上海知识产权法院\" (y=506, x=530). And crucially, below that, under \"赔偿金额\" (Compensation Amount), it shows \"¥ 3,200,000\" (y=614, x=812). So, for (2025)沪73民初45号, the amount is ¥ 3,200,000.

And the \"同步时间\" (Sync Time) is still 2025-04-02. This means the data is fixed up to April 2025. \"近 60 日\" (recent 60 days) is Feb-April 2025. Case (2025)京73民终81号 might be in this Feb-April 2025 range. Case (2024)粤73民终1172号 is from 2024, so it won't be in the \"近 60 日\" section relative to April 2025.

Since the \"同步时间\" is old, and I am looking for cases from 2024 and 2025, and the page seems limited to data up to April 2025 (and \"近 60 日\" before that), it's possible the data for (2024)粤73民终1172号 is not even in the dataset this page is using, and maybe (2025)京73民终81号 is also outside the Feb-April 2025 window.
